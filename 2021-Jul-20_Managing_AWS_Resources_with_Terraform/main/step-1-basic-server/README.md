# Step-1

Well it's a server - a VM running Ubuntu but

- how can we connect to the server ?
  - the web server
  - ssh to get a shell
  - there is no security group to open up the ssh and web server ports

- there is no actual web server running

- we use our own ubuntu image for this region
  - but it is limited to us-west-1
  - how can we run with the latest ubuntu image for a selected region?
